# Endangered Species in U.S. National Parks

This project analyzes data from the **National Park Service** on endangered species across different parks. The goal is to explore conservation statuses, clean and visualize the data, and identify patterns or themes in the types of species that are most at risk.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Cleaning & Analysis**  
  Process and organize species data to make it usable for exploration.  

- **Visualization**  
  Create meaningful plots to show trends in conservation status across parks.  

- **Pattern Discovery**  
  Investigate whether certain categories of species (e.g., mammals, plants, birds) are more likely to become endangered.  

- **Insights & Reporting**  
  Summarize findings in a clear, data-driven way to highlight themes in conservation challenges within the National Park system.

By the end of this project, the analysis provides a deeper understanding of endangered species trends and the broader implications for biodiversity conservation in U.S. National Parks.
